# PhoneGap Build Extension for Brackets

The goal of this project is to create an extension that allows Brackets 
users an easy path to getting web projects from Brackets into a mobile 
application. 

To do this, there are a couple of things the extension must do:

* Associate a folder with a PhoneGap Build Project **(Done)**
* Synch a folder with the associated PhoneGap Build Project
* Maintain the current status of the PhoneGap Build Project (Building, Success, Error) **(Done)**

There are also some things that might be nice, but aren't necessary:

* Prompt for download of apps
* Allow PhoneGap Build Management

Things that we will have to figure out:

* Getting files up to PhoneGap Build
* Associating Folders with PGB Projects **(Done)**
* How to build a pleasing UI. 

TODO's

* Create local storage for:
    * file location to project link
* Figure out how to handle online/offline
* Figure out how to upload files from Brackets to PhoneGap Build.
* Make the UI Prettier, it's pretty lame right now.
