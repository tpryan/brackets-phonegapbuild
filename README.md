PhoneGapBuild Extension for Brackets

The goal of this project is to create an extension that allows Brackets 
users an easy path to getting web projects from Brackets into a mobile 
application. 

To do this, there are a couple of things the extension must do:

* Associate a folder with a PhoneGap Build Project
* Synch a folder with the associated PhoneGap Build Project
* Maintain the current status of the PhoneGap Build Project (Building, Success, Error) 

There are also some things that might be nice, but aren't necessary:

* Prompt for download of apps
* Allow PhoneGap Build Management
